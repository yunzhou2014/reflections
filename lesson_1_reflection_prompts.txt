How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that
was introduced?

    it's easier to pinpoint the location

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a better
programmer in the long term?

    you can see how the file has been changed

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a
commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google
docs does?
    
    pros: you get to decide when is appropriate to commit.
	cons: you might have too big/ small commits.

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple
files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

    sometimes, it makes sense to track multiple files together rather than separately, like html and css

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?
    
    git log + downarrow to find the id corresponding to a message, press q to quit. then git diff first_id second_id to find the difference (+ add, - delete)
	
	git config --global color.ui auton to get colored diff output

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that
could break something?
    
    you can check out old versions of code, go back to current head 

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?

    create a repo, branch, merge
