What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
	
	a .git folder is created. Because I need to create a repository?

git init
git add
git commit
(git reset   // remove file from staging area)
git status

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?

	it is between the two statuses. You can think twice before you commit changes.
